How do you setup what colors you have available?
There is a txt file "Available_Colors.txt".
You modify it to mark what colors you have, by entering an X between the [ ] of a given color.
Like in this example: "[X]------ White", meaning you have white color or "[ ]------ White", meaning you don't have white color.
