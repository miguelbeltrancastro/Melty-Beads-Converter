# Melty-Beads-Converter
Turn your images into Hama beads patterns

With this tool you can:
- Set the dimmension of you beads pad (meant to be squared)
- Set what colors you have available

With this tool you get:
- Number of beads needed of each color
- An image file with the pattern

How do you setup what colors you have available?
There is a txt file "Available_Colors.txt".
You modify it to mark what colors you have, by entering an X between the [ ] of a given color.
Like in this example: "[X]------ White", meaning you have white color or "[ ]------ White", meaning you don't have white color.

To run it, use: python Melty-Beads-Converter.py XXXXX.YYY

(with XXXXX.YYY the name and extension of the image you want to convert)
